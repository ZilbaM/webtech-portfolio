## Three.js features

- About Section BSpline: used Three.js lines and Bspline functions to animate a curve in the background.
- Rotating polaroid: The polaroid turns to the mouse when we approach the mouse hover it.
- Project models: rotating and rotable (drag with your mouse) object related to the projects.

## Not made by me :

- The city & piano model 
- That's it !

## Where to look :

In the `src/Components` folder are the different section of the portfolio each in a separate file. I put the three.js code at the end of each file to be able to easily locate it.
